## Abstract
My Yonkuma is based on my body of work, Duskfire Chronicles. In doing so, I wanted to show how my characters interact with each other while also showing how versatile black hair can be. Using AI generative photos to suggest what style the sister should have.

Having an interest in black culture I wanted to really focus if AI can really be helpful for coming up with hairstyles for black women. I think it's important to ask these questions because when looking at AI generative images the first thing that usually pops up is someone not of color."Many Black artists are finding evidence of racial bias in artificial intelligence, both in the large data sets that teach machines how to generate images and in the underlying programs that run the algorithms”.(1) Why is that with so much vast knowledge AI claims to have it can't think of someone of color if not told to do so before hand.“Given that AI technologies typically just regurgitate the information that is already available on the internet, it makes sense that there is a gap in advice that caters to hairstyles that are popular in the Black community it's reflecting the lack of knowledge that is present in the real world”.(2) With this thought in mind, I wanted to use the main female character Nia from my body of work. While trying the best hairstyles more intune with 4c hair that an AI generative website can come up with.



## Methodology
[![4-comma][images-fig3]](https://example.com)

*Figure 3. My first attempt at finding type 4 hairstyles for black women(SmartHairAI)*


For my process I began to look up different AI websites that would generate images and ones that specifically catered to hairstyles. The first website I used was called SmartHairAi. This website asked for a hair pattern, inspired by, persona, hair length and angle. I put in black 4c for a hair pattern, inspired by an African American,  persona as a woman , medium or long hair length and front face to show the full hair. Unfortunately, the hairstyles were not 4c and most of them weren't even 4 type hair. I did it multiple times and even one time I think I asked for too much and it gave me a result that seems like a white woman with red hair facing another way. For the next website it was called creator night cafe. This website lets me write whatever I can think of. Surprisingly after my last attempt i got a render with a model with 4c hair which i knew i was going in the right direction. I used two more websites that were similar to the last and not much had different results and was wondering if I would ever get good results.

## Result and Future Work


After many trials of finding the right kind of hair for African American women, I finally found a good match in ChatGPT. I used the paid version from my friend and asked to type in black hairstyles for black women with 4c hair and results were successful. It also generated multiple choices in one search which was not common in other websites. I can see with my future work if I need to find hairstyles for my black characters. I could generate ideas on the paid version and have a very accurate result.

## Conclusion


After this project I definitely feel black people, especially black women in AI are very important to show. People don't seem to realize the importance of having inclusion in these different spaces. And I will continue to work hard and show my people in ways not seen often.
